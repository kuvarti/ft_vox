Based on the project requirements, we can divide the work between two people, ensuring that both are coding and that their tasks do not overlap.

### Roadmap for Two Developers (2-Month Plan)

**Week 1-2:**
- **Person A**: Procedural World Generation
  - Focus on generating the terrain based on deterministic methods (mountains, caves, etc.).
  - Implement memory management for visited terrain chunks, ensuring cubes are stored and removed as needed.
  - Start creating the different types of cubes (e.g., grass, ground, sand) with basic placeholders for textures.
  
- **Person B**: Camera and Movement Controls
  - Set up the camera movement and mouse controls (moving on 2 axes).
  - Implement movement keys (forward, backward, left, right) and ensure speed scaling functionality is in place.
  - Prepare the foundation for a smooth interaction between the user and the world.

**Week 3-4:**
- **Person A**: Terrain Optimization and Procedural Generation Refinements
  - Optimize terrain generation for performance, making sure the system is capable of handling 16384x256x16384 cubes.
  - Ensure that the world generation has natural-looking topography (avoid simple randomization).
  - Save terrain states and remove unused blocks from memory to manage resource consumption.
  
- **Person B**: Graphics Rendering (Part 1)
  - Implement basic graphics rendering for the cubes, ensuring a minimal render distance of 160 cubes.
  - Begin implementing texture loading for cubes (start with at least 2 types and textures).
  - Set up OpenGL or Vulkan for rendering and handle communication between CPU and GPU for a smooth experience.

**Week 5-6:**
- **Person A**: Further Terrain Enhancements
  - Enhance procedural terrain by adding more diversity to landscapes (hills, caves, mountains).
  - Ensure determinism of world generation based on seed values.
  
- **Person B**: Graphics Rendering (Part 2) & Skybox
  - Refine the cube rendering to ensure the userâ€™s field of view is always filled with elements.
  - Implement a skybox to add depth to the environment.
  - Optimize the rendering to prevent freeze frames and ensure smooth transitions.

**Week 7-8:**
- **Person A**: Final Terrain Optimizations & Testing
  - Finalize the terrain generation, testing for different seeds and ensuring the system scales effectively.
  - Make sure memory management works properly when removing and loading chunks of terrain.

- **Person B**: Final Rendering & Camera Polishing
  - Finalize the graphic rendering system, adding more textures and ensuring smoothness in all conditions (including when speed is multiplied by 20).
  - Ensure the camera controls and interactions are polished and work seamlessly with the terrain.

### Collaboration:
- **Integration Testing**: Both developers need to test the integration between world generation and camera controls. This should happen by **week 6**, where both the world is fully generated, and the camera can navigate without issues.
  
- **Code Review & Optimization**: Regular code reviews and tests should be conducted to ensure the project performs smoothly. Ideally, reserve the last week for testing, debugging, and final performance tweaks.

This way, both developers will be actively involved in coding distinct parts of the project without overlapping responsibilities.
